# Enigma Simulator

An Enigma machine simulator written in Rust for funsies.

## About The Project

Saw a documentary about WWII so I thought I'd see how hard it'd be to implement an Enigma machine.

## Getting Started

### Usage

1. Run the following to start the Enigma machine simulation

`cargo run -r`
